# D1 Mini IR Shield

## Description

A simple board for controlling IR devices using an ESP8266 DevKit and ESPHome.

I wanted a way to control my IR devices, such as TVs and air conditioners, without the need for cloud enabled devices or inflexible solutions such as Broadlink Universal Remotes. Moreover, I wanted something that could run ESPHome so that I can customize it as I see fit, and access the multitude of free and public libraries that are available. The solution was to develop my own board: the D1 Mini IR Shield!
